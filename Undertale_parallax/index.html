            <h2>Main story</h2>
            <p>Long ago, two races ruled over the Earth: Humans and Monsters. One day, a war broke out between the two races. After a long battle, the humans were victorious. Seven of their greatest magicians confined the monsters to the Underground with a magic barrier. However, this barrier is not perfect.</p>
            <p>Many years after the war, in 201X, a human child climbs Mount Ebott for their own mysterious reason. It is said that those who climb the mountain never return. The child discovers an enormous hole in the mountain and falls in.</p>

            <h2>The War of Humans and Monsters</h2>
            <p>The War of Humans and Monsters was a legendary clash that took place long before the events of Undertale.</p>
            <p>At the time, humans and monsters ruled the Earth. One day, humans attacked the monsters abruptly and mercilessly, out of fear of their only weakness: having their SOUL absorbed by a monster.</p>
            <p>Monsters were too weak to put up a fight; the SOUL of nearly every monster combined is only just as strong as the power of one human SOUL. Countless monsters were massacred, without a single human SOUL taken. Few monsters survived, one of which was Gerson. Eventually, the monsters surrendered, and the humans emerged victorious. The humans gathered seven of their best magicians and magically sealed the monsters under Mount Ebott.</p>

            <h2>Aftermath</h2>
            <p>After the war, the monsters retreated into the deepest part of the Underground, which they called "Home." After a period had passed, fearing the humans no longer, they populated the rest of the Underground and made their capital in a place they called "New Home."</p>
            <p>Monsters mostly blamed the war on humanity and took a vengeful look at the human race. This bitterness, especially after the death of Asriel and his adopted sibling, led King Asgore to declare war against humanity, installing a policy to kill all humans that fell into the Underground and eradicate humans once the seven SOULs needed to break the barrier are collected.</p>
